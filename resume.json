I've worked in multiple industries and environments including fast paced startups, advertising shops, and Enterprise InsureTechs. I love working on teams who are excited and passionate about learning together and solving interesting problems.\n\nWhile Frontend Engineering is my strongest technical skillset, I've worked heavily across the stack and shipped backend applications and APIs for over a decade. I've managed Data and App Engineering teams, responsible for both day-to-day delivery of large objectives as well as working with other thought leaders across the organization to better understand their needs and goals. I've led engineering teams on building engineering best practices and developing mature development processes, hiring practices, (aA)gile rollouts, set architectural vision and I've been a teacher for a local JavaScript bootcamp. I've proven to myself that I'm an impact hire on any team I join.\n\nI'm looking for an Engineering led company with a growth mindset culture, appreciation for Humans over employees, and pride in its quest for excellence in Engineering, Culture, Communication and Kindness. It's important to me that I work with others who possess a positive outlook and genuinely enjoy working with one another. ",
